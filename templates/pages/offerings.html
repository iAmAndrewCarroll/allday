        The examination of this embodied experience. Requires a shift of mindset. In this moment you understand that we are one and the same. The archetypes of light and dark become nondualistic. This is the work.

        Turn away from nothing. Go into the darkest darkness. So thick it creates friction. Know this place. Love this place. For the slave shall serve. The Master. The god. Shall be served.

        I am. Love and Truth. Hatred and Chaos. Life and Death. Black and White. I am the traveler in darkness. I am the sailor of light. I was conceived in rape. I was born in love. I am the child of the sun. I am the daughter of the moon.

        Deny the shadow, become enslaved. Often in painfully obvious ways. Kneeling at the throne death. Weak and powerless. You give yourself away. Embrace every cell of your being. Every vibration of your soul. Become One.

      The River Styx. Nine evolutions. Broken bread with the gods. As above. So below. I transcend into the light. Risen from darkness. We are all meant to make this journey. To walk in service to Love and Truth is to integrate every part of your being. The pieces of yourself that you try to spit out. Pieces you hide from others. Pieces you are ashamed of. This is self-deletion. This is death. This is Hell.
      
      Come. Into the light, child. Come into acceptance. Do your work. Be brave. Stand firm.

      Your voice will set you free. Only you can do this. You must save yourself. You must.

      I am here to help you. I am here to guide you. I am here to love you. I am here with an offering.
